<h2 align="left">A bit about me</h2>

Hi friends! ðŸ‘‹ **I'm Adolfo David Romero**, an aspiring **full-stack developer** based in **Toronto, Canada**. I recently graduated with a degree in **Computer Science**, specializing in **Mobile Computing**. My passion lies in **frontend & backend web development**, **software engineering**, and **mobile development** (both **native** and **cross-platform**).

Outside of coding, I'm a multi-instrumentalist musician with a love for all kinds of music â€” youâ€™ll probably find me in line for upcoming concerts (because the front row is always worth it!) ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ¶ I also enjoy diving into literature and sci-fi/fantasy books, so if you have any great recommendations, send them my way! ðŸ™ŒðŸ“š
